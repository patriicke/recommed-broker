      Contracts for difference (CFDs) are complex instruments that come with a
      high risk of losing money rapidly, so you should definitely learn more
      about it before starting CFD trading. That said, your broker search should
      concentrate on safe, properly regulated brokers that are specialized in
      CFDs and have low CFD and withdrawal fees. You should also consider the
      number of CFDs available, and the overall quality of the service, with
      special emphasis on quick and helpful customer support. You can use Find
      My Broker to identify some good CFD broker options.
